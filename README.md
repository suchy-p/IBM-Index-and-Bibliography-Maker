# Index and Bibliography Maker
Index and Bibligraphy Maker (IBM in short) was created as an attempt to automate one of most time consuming and boring parts of publishing book in humanities.
Creating personal index can take anywhere from several days to over a week. Also bibliography is often neglected by authors (or can be real pain if you're writing), so the editor has to go through all footnotes to check, correct or even create one.
Goal of this app is to do both things for you using natural language processing. All you have to do is check output files for nlp model mistakes, radically reducing time required to do both things from days to, in most cases, under an hour.
